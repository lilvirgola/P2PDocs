## ðŸ“Œ Project Description

**P2PDocs** is a decentralized collaborative text editor that implements a serverless architecture, eliminating single points of failure inherent in client-server models. The system enables real-time concurrent editing through direct peer-to-peer communication in a dynamic network topology.

Users should be able to edit the text even while offline, and the system should automatically resolve emerging conflicts once the connection is re-established.
